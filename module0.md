## Google Colab
[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org), [Keras](http://keras.io), and [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) are three of the biggest ML frameworks today. 

For the IntelSys ml-curriculum, we'll use [Google Colaboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI), which allows you to get started right away without a need to establish a development environment on your laptop. There's nothing to install, and you won't have to worry about any hardware limitations on your machine.

For this module, start with this [intro notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to get a gist of how Google Colab works.

Then, check out this [PyTorch notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gCgtlnMPVWY0l1ra8ssS0EzJiWaVR4Pk) for an example of a Colab notebook using PyTorch.

In the next module [(Module 1)](module1.md), follow along with the tutorials using a Google Colab notebook.
