# ML Curriculum for Computer Vision and Object Detection

## Prerequisistes

* Basic understanding of Python (variables, classes, for loops)
* Knowledge of probability, statistics, linear algebra, and multivariate calculus is required! No math review follows.
* Basic learning of machine learning goes a long way, but is not needed.
